          <h3>Which design features would I like to implement?</h3>
          <p>Based off of the practice excerize from Zen Garden I would to implement a sidebar in my future website. I'd also like to add some small discreet symbol type images.</p>

          <h3>How would you describe HTML, CSS and the DOM to your non-technical friend?</h3>
          <p>HTML is like the the building materials you have before you build a house, CSS is what decides how these materials are positioned and used to effectively build and style a structure and the DOM is the resulting floor plan (which can be used as a concept before doing CSS work).</p>

          <h3>What is boxifying design?</h3>
          <p>Boxifying design is the understanding that all elements on a webpage are positioned within a box, and to correctly format and position the contents of a webpage a series of boxes will be needed to allow proper formating, so the developer plans out how these boxes will be correctly utilised. For example: For a section such as a header to look how a developer wants, he may need first a header element, then an img element to hold a logo, another div element to hold a menu item, etc etc.</p>

          <h3>What is the box model?</h3>
          <p>The box model relates to every element, every element has a box which consists of margins, padding, borders and their internal content.</p>
