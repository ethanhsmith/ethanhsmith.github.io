      <h3>First Time and Habits Blog Post</h3>
      <p>I found the articles on creating new habits and working with the mind very intriguing. I'm going to test out the technique for building new habits which was linked from a youtube TEDX talk, a technique which complements my prexisting meditation practice. The Pomodoro technqiue is something I've heard about in the past and I'd like to try this method as well.</p>
