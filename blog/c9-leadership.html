            <h5>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h5>
            <p>
              I've had 2 jobs before, and at either of them there was no fully compassionate leadership. My first job had a military style ex-cop managing a supermarket floor who would side with whoever could flirt with him the best, to which I admit I couldn't contend! My most recent job had a whole culture of management looking down on the staff but not in a healthy way, those who joined in with compassion were soon whipped into line and became less compassionate towards "underlings". However, this is because they to were not treated with compassion and were stressed to the max. I look forward to working in a company where I'm lead with compassion. My previous roles have shown me that compassion is very important in a workplace for ensuring productivity and stability of any job.

             <h5>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h5>
             <p>
               I always look for the goodness in everyone, the people who suffer the most have high barriers but there is good in everyone.

             <h5>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h5>
             <p>
               ...

             <h5>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h5>
             <p>
               SCARF applies to every experience of human interaction. For Phase 0 the experience has been very peaceful and non-threatening, so in that way I'd say it's applied well to this phase and hopefully will continue in this manner in bootcamp.

             <h5>Any other musings?</h5>
             <p>
               No. Chapter 8 was a good chapter and I'm looking forward to the course.
