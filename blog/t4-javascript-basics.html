          <h3>Javascript Basics</h3>
            <h5>How does Javascript compare to HTML and CSS?</h5>
            <p>
                HTML and CSS build the bones of the contents body whereas Javascript acts more like your organs, performing functions and helping the body to correctly operate.
            </p>

            <h5>Talk about control flow and loops as if everyday life.</h5>
            <p>
                When you're brushing your teeth there is a certain method and technique to ensure you've maximised dental hygiene, normally this involves repeating a simple task such as "brush tooth" that is then repeated until completion. In this example, a for loop would ensure all teeth are brushed as it would stop brushing teeth when there are none left unclean! We do many repetitive tasks everyday, habits, routines, and they can all be broken down with programming into loops.
            </p>

            <h5>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h5>
            <p>
              Arrays have to be initialised as one variable, with various variables within, whereas an object can be created numerous times with vastly different stores of information which makes it easier to be able to store information. Also, objects are able to have functions and programs running within themselves to regulate code, this could technicially be done by an array, but imagine the pain!
            </p>

            <h5>Explain what functions are and why they're useful.</h5>
            <p>
              Functions are mini programs that are designed to operate on objects or variables, you can pass them information, they can pass you information, or they can do both! These make code dynamic and able to do more complex things, such as a setter function which will set a variable in an object while checking there are no upcoming errors that could break the code.
