          <p>Enspiral Dev Academy appears to be a solid way of learning the skills required for a development job in a short period of time. This education is not limited to the technical understanding behind such a position, but also encompasses the learning of important team skills required in developing good code. When I decided to start at EDA I didn't have many expectations for what was to come in the course, and so far I'm enjoying the culture and how the course is structured towards helping one another. I'm a little bit nervous about what's to come, but it's a healthy type of nervous, a type that leads to results.</p>
